Currently what we have here is our third whitebox scene with the most 
recent update to our scripts. 
The ai is certainly buggy (he goes through walls) but that is not the main
focus currently. 
Doors will be remade for next milestone
Disguses can be equipped but they do not do anything mechanically currently
	(that will be next milestone)
Hacking brings up an interface, a game will be included next milestone

ALSO, LOSING THE GAME (caught by guard) WILL BRING YOU TO MENU SCENE.
CLICKING START LOADS THE WRONG SCENE, MUST REPLAY THE SCENE FROM UNITY
